MonoHgg analysis

---------------------------------------
From MicroAOD to diPhotonAnaTrees 
(follow what is done here from P. Musella: https://github.com/cms-analysis/flashgg/tree/master/MetaData 
 and here from C. Rovelli: https://github.com/musella/diphotons/tree/master/fullAnalysisRoma )
---------------------------------------

1.Once MicroAOD files are produced run these scripts to create the json file (catalogue) and  compute the weights:

   1.1 fggManageSamples.py -C testMonoHLivia -V Phys14MicroAODV3-55-gc1f8d91 import
   1.2 fggManageSamples.py -C testMonoHLivia review
   1.3 fggManageSamples.py -C testMonoHLivia check

2. Now the json file can be copied on github in the script/list_*/  directory
   2.1 If json file is not separated by name can extract smaller json files with:
       ./runExtractJSONS which calls:
       python extractJSONS.py -i input.json -o samplename -d outputdir
       for the samples (currently in RunII_50ns catalog)

3. Extract files and weights to create .list and .weight files in script/list_*/:
   3.1 Write the proper name of the catalogue in the extract*.py scripts
   3.2 python extractWeights.py
   3.3 python extractFiles.py
   OR ./runExtractFilesAndWeights.sh to do the same thing (takes input list of .json files and outputs weight and files in same list dir.)

4. Run in local the diphoton analyzer (from python directory):
   4.1 Write by hand one microAOD file that can be taken from the json file
   4.2 Fix by hand xsec and sumDataSet that can be found from the json file corresponding
   4.3 cmsRun diPhoAna.py
   
5. Run in batch the diphoton analyzer (from script directory):
   
   5.1 To make it works one needs:
       - a list of files in script/listV*/ with the name  GJets_HT-100to200
       - a list of weights in script/listV*/ with the name GJets_HT-100to200
       - the value of the xsec
       - the output directory either in eos or in lxpus (this has to be fixed in the submitBatchDiPho.py script by hand)
 
   5.2 Example on how to run: ./submitBatchDiPho.py --cfg diPhoAnaBATCH.py GJets_HT-100to200 0 7 pippo 1534. 1 
       NB. The name GJets_HT-100to200 has to match the one of the .list and the .weight files.
       

6. Manage the output trees before making plots (from smacro directory):
   6.1 Merge the output files with mergeTrees.sh
   6.2 Add the weights to the trees with addWeightsToTree.cc
   6.3 Merge the species with mergeSpecies.sh
   NB. The structure of how to use these scripts can be seen in doAll.sh

7. Produce plots 
   in CMSSW_7_4_6_patch2
   7.1 make (to compile) 
   7.2 ./main (to run)
     In main.cpp if
     (makePURWfiles)	calls ReweightPU.cpp	(makes PURW files for samples)
     (doReweightPU)  	opens PURW files  	(doPURW instead of weighting=1)
     (doPlots) 		calls Plotter.cpp 	(histos for each sample individually)
     (doComb)  		calls Combiner.cpp 	(overlay and stack samples)
     (doABCD)		calls ABCDMethod.cpp	(do ABCD/C&C analysis) 
     style set with Style.cpp

   in CMSSW_7_4_0_pre9
   7.1 Run drawOneHisto.C to plot a single variable for a single sample
	OR
   7.1 Compile (with make) and run ./main to plot all relevant variables for a single sample (with weighting) 
   7.2 Run combiner.C to plot a single variable for all samples (needs the output of plotter.C)
    OR use runCombiner.sh that runs combiner.C for all relevant variables for all samples (also needs output of plotter.C)
